# Ultramarathon Analysis 2020 USA

## Overview
This project conducts a detailed analysis of ultramarathon races in the USA for the year 2020, focusing on events that are 50km and 50mi in length. It aims to uncover insights into athlete performances, gender distributions among participants, and the impact of age on average speed.

## Data Source
The data is sourced from a CSV file titled `TWO_CENTURIES_OF_UM_RACES.csv`, containing comprehensive details on ultramarathon events over two centuries, including event names, distances, participant details, and performance metrics.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to focus on 50km and 50mi races in the USA for the year 2020.
- Analysis of athlete age and adjustment of performance metrics for better readability.
- Visualization of race length distributions and gender participation.
- Examination of the relationship between athlete age and average speed.

## Usage
1. Import the necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation, seaborn and matplotlib for visualization.
2. Load the dataset using pandas and apply the provided preprocessing steps to clean and filter the data according to the project's focus.
3. Explore the cleaned dataset through various visualizations to gain insights into the ultramarathon events and participants.
